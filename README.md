# Style Flip

Style Flip is a little app for mixing and match separates, and shopping similar fashion. Built as a showcase project, using images from an old copy of Vogue, and products from [Lyst](http://lyst.co.uk). Currently live [here](http://style-flip.herokuapp.com).

### What is this built in?

On the frontend, I've used SASS and vanilla JavaScript. On the backend, I've used Node.js and a Redis database. Front and backend tests are written using Mocha and Chai. The app has been deployed to Heroku.

### Why?
